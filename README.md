# FCOS: Object Detector
This is an implementation of single-stage anchor-free object detector introduced in paper `FCOS: A Simple and Strong Anchor-free Object Detector` https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09214

A lot of the code is adapted from the pytorch implementation here https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/detection/fcos.py
